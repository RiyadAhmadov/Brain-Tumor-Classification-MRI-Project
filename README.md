**Brain Tumor Detection and Classification System**
================================================

**Introduction**
---------------

A Brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases, among children and adults. Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors. Every year, around 11,700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor. The 5-year survival rate for people with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor is approximately 34 percent for men and 36 percent for women.

**Problem Statement**
-------------------

Brain tumors are classified into different types, including Benign Tumor, Malignant Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, etc. Proper treatment, planning, and accurate diagnostics should be implemented to improve the life expectancy of the patients. The best technique to detect brain tumors is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, manual examination of MRI images by radiologists can be error-prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties.

**Solution**
------------

To address the problem of inaccurate diagnosis and classification of brain tumors, we propose a system that uses Deep Learning Algorithms with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Transfer Learning (TL). Our system will enable doctors to automatically detect and classify brain tumors with higher accuracy than manual classification.

**Features**
---------

* **Image Preprocessing**: MRI images will be preprocessed to enhance the quality and remove noise.
* **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A CNN will be used to extract features from the preprocessed images.
* **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: An ANN will be used to classify the extracted features into different tumor types.
* **Transfer Learning (TL)**: TL will be used to fine-tune the ANN model using a large dataset of labeled images.

**Benefits**
---------

* **Improved Accuracy**: Our system will provide more accurate diagnosis and classification of brain tumors.
* **Reduced Errors**: The system will reduce errors associated with manual examination of MRI images.
* **Faster Diagnosis**: The system will enable faster diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.

**Conclusion**
--------------

In conclusion, our Brain Tumor Detection and Classification System using Deep Learning Algorithms will provide a more accurate and efficient way to diagnose and classify brain tumors. We believe that our system will have a significant impact on the medical field and improve patient outcomes.
